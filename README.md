# TwitterAPI

As a student in Applied Computer Science, I often hear people ask: “Which language should I learn?”. Often times each person has their own bias, but if there were a way to decide, I think that one should learn a language that is most commonly used as that would be more beneficial for the person. Therefore I decided to put the Twitter API into practice with PowerShell and see which language is most trending. I tried to collect the number of tweets mentioning each of 7 programming languages I specified (C, Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, Swift, PHP) over the span of 1 week. Then I would analyse that data and publish ad tweet stating the result on my twitter account.
